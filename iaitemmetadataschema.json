General uploaders with no special privs can only upload to selected “Community” collections or the test_collection. Items in the test_collection are removed from the site after 30 days. Parent collections If the parent collections of an item's collections are not already included in the item's own collection list, they will be automatically added (at the end of the next task on the item). Here, more specifically, is how that addition takes place: All of the item's currently listed collections are considered in turn. For each of them, we trace its ancestry all the way up to the top-level collection (usually a mediatype); in tracing ancestry, we consider only the primary (first-listed) parent collection at each step. If the original item is itself a collection, we include the top-level collection, otherwise we don't. Any collection we encounter during this traversal of the hierarchy that isn't already in the item's collection list gets added to the end of the list. For example, if the original item starts with collections A and B listed, we find A's primary parent (call it A-P), that collection's primary parent (A-P-P), etc., until we hit a mediatype; all of those that aren't already listed get added, including the mediatype if the item itself is a collection. Then we do the same for B and its primary parent B-P, B-P-P, etc."
